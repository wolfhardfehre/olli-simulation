# Open Olli Simulation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wolfhardfehre/olli-simulation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wolfhardfehre/olli-simulation)

## Introduction

A small tool to simulate the movement of a autonomous shuttle called 'Olli'. This repository is part of the
[Open Olli Hackathon][1] and will build the foundation for a On-Demand-System consisting of a server and a
mobile application. The underlying vehicle data can be found [here][2]. To build a rail like infrastructure
[OpenStreetMap][3] data is used and queried through the [OverpassApi][4].
